This repository contains the working preprint and supporting materials for a mathematical framework I call τ-analysis, a formalism designed to encode irreversible phenomena through geometric and topological structures. The central construction is the τ-manifold, a generalized hyperbolic space locally modeled on an isomorphic R^(nX) manifold, within which dispersion, information flow, and irreversibility acquire tensorial and differentiable structure.
