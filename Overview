Irreversibility is a fundamental topic in both pure and applied sciences,
including mathematics, mathematical physics, and complex systems. Despite extensive efforts by leading researchers, traditional methods often
rely on approximations or computationally intensive algorithms. Consequently, many irreversible phenomena — such as entropy evolution or
complex economic fluctuations — remain only partially understood.

The introduction of the novel concepts in this paper contained concerns
about encoding irreversibility as a dispersive phenomena in a hyperbolic
topological manifold - regarding singularities created by the dynamics of
the irreversible phenomena - breaking out complex entangled systems (via
tensors) to a topological interpretation of the manifold of irreversibility,
called τ-space.

Thorughout the paper, equations such as conditions for τ-triviality and τ-analiticity; tensor interpretation of τ-holomorphic functions; normalization of τ-functions; and n-dimensional irreversible integration are developed within the framework of τ-analysis.
